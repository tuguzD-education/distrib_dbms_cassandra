        on the social context of the game, both on the side of the producer and the
        consumer. For the sociological analysis it is important to gain an important
        amount of knowledge about the social factors of the time of production. A

        only on the surface and is concentrated on all elements and their mutual

        influence for a shorter or longer period the emotions of the recipient.
        Strictly spoken each gamer should be interviewed for his or her feelings
        during reception, as numerous details have their influence on the reception
        of a game. But on the other hand it is safe to assume that many of the
        impressions gained during gameplay are intersubjective.'

        (or a representational selection) from the same developers studio (or
        distributor, leading artist, etc.) or possibly a related group or
        development. It puts a game in the context of its background or context
        during its development, and shows the development of a developers studio
        or a type of games. In the same way it is possible to compare games from
        two different, but for certain reasons comparable, developers or studios.
        This type of comparison focusses on the differences and the resemblances
        between games, and/or developers. This type of analysis provides a large
        amount of information on games and its makers. As it has no clear boundaries
        it is important to clearly define the subjects this analysis will focuss on
        to begin with, but with the possibility to expand the range of research on a
        later moment if necessary.'
