        a custom interactive, a visually moving infographic would be your best bet.

        for podcasting. Podcasts are a perfect combination because they are
        relatively low-cost to create and with the variety of recording and playing
        options, it is something almost anyone can do. Not only that, users love
        the break from reading a blog post or digesting a graphic. A podcast is easy
        for users to listen to and provides a ton of value. Additionally, smartphones
        make podcasts accessible and easy to share. A podcast could be a perfect
        investment for your company if you’re looking for another way to reach your
        consumers. Not only can you offer entertaining and valuable information, but
        you can reach a new audience that your blog articles or infographics
        are not touching.'
