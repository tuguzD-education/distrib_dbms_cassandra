        game industry to organize efforts within a development team. The document
        is created by the development team as result of collaboration between their
        designers, artists and programmers as a guiding vision which is used
        throughout the game development process. When a game is commissioned by a
        game publisher to the development team, the document must be created by the
        development team and it is often attached to the agreement between publisher
        and developer, which has to adhere to the GDD during game development process.',

        document is expanded by the developer to a level where it can successfully
        guide the development team. Because of the dynamic environment of game
        development, the document is often changed, revised and expanded as
        development progresses and changes in scope and direction are explored.
        As such, a game design document is often referred to as a living document,
        that is, a piece of work which is continuously improved upon throughout
        the implementation of the project, sometimes as often as daily. A document
        may start off with only the basic concept outlines and become a complete,
