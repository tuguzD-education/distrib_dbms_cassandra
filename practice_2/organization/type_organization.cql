        division name or have been an independent studio before being acquired
        by the console manufacturer. Whether by purchasing an independent studio
        or by founding a new team, the acquisition of a first-party developer
        involves a huge financial investment on the part of the console manufacturer,

        distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute
        the games they publish. Other functions usually performed by the publisher
        include deciding on and paying for any licenses used by the game,
        paying for localization, layout, printing, and possibly the writing
        of the user manual, and the creation of graphic design elements such as
        the box design. Some large publishers with vertical structure also
        own publishing subsidiaries (labels).'
