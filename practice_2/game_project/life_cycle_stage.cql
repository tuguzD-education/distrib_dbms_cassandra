        questions will need to be answered. Ideating a video game is one
        of the hardest parts of game development. The idea a gaming studio
        comes up with will serve as the backbone of the entire game. It’s what
        sets the standard for every employee involved with building the game,
        but also gives publishers a high-level overview of what to expect.
        This brings us to the next part of development – proofing a concept.
        A proof of concept takes all the ideas that have been generated and
        sees how viable they are for the gaming studio to produce.'

        project leads, and other crucial departments collaborate on the scope
        of the video game and where each piece of the puzzle fits. From here,
        it’s common for studios to prototype characters, environments, interfaces,
        control schemes, and other in-game elements to see how they
        look, feel, and interact with one another. This is essentially

        is too hard or too easy, or complete the entire game to see if it was
        satisfying enough. After countless hours of testing and iterating,
        the game should be ready for a late-Alpha or even Beta release, depending

        of bugs to squash. This hierarchy will include “game-crashing” bugs
        near the top and minor bugs near the bottom. In addition to bug squashing,
        developers will typically polish the game as much as possible before

        to launch with batches of minor bugs. The first few months during the
        post-launch stage are typically spent identifying and squashing these bugs.
        Gaming studios also rely on players to submit bug reports or speak up about
        bugs in online forums. This is all part of post-launch support. Another
        part of post-launch is to provide regular software updates for the game.
        These updates range from game-balancing patches to new downloadable
        content, or DLCs. Releasing fresh content is common in today’s gaming
        industry because it increases the replay value and appeal of a game.
        New levels, storylines, and multiplayer modes are just a few of the
        many DLC options a gaming studio could explore.'
